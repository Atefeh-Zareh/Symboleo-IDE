We are applying for the RE'20 *Artifacts Available* badge. 

The reason for it being, the *replicated* and *reproduced* badges do not apply to our artifact. Additionally, the artifacts have yet to pass extensive testing and the documents for them are not complete. Therefore, we are not applying for the *reusable* badge either.
